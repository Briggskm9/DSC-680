The Travel Channel claims that their television show is conducting scientific exploration of the primate like creature, Bigfoot.  They use the algorithm to find out the best possibility to find the creature within a 17-day timeframe and at a specific location.  With the increase growth of technology, it is becoming harder for Bigfoot to remain hidden.  They use drones, thermal devices, LIDAR and other new technology to collect evidence. 

In this project Python was used for cleaning and EDA.  R was used for clustering and maps of clusters. 

With the data insights that were discovered it is possible to track the  movements of Bigfoot.
